        <p>Terminal Development Kit - Documentation (${VERSION})</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/skippyr/libtdk" target="_blank">View Source Code</a><br /></p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>A simple C99 terminal manipulation library for Linux and Windows that can be used to develop cross-platform terminal application using C and C++. In summary, it includes features to manipulate terminal properties, styles and key events encoded in UTF-8.</p>
        <p>Designed to be an alternative to curses-like libraries, it offers a solid base for creating general purpose terminal based softwares, while leaving room to full-feature libraries to be built upon for more specific use cases.</p>
        <p>Throughout this documentation, you will learn the basics of the terminal and how to use libtdk's functions to manipulate it.</p>
        <h2>Reserved Names</h2>
        <p>This library reserves all names that starts with <code>tdk</code> possibly prefixed by an underline to indicate that it is isolated to its own implementation.</p>
        <h2>What Is A Terminal</h2>
        <p>The terminal is a simple human-computer interface that allow people to interact with an operating system through a text based-command interpreter software called "shell".</p>
        <p>In the old days, a terminal used to be a real machine, but in the modern era its behavior is emulated through a software called "terminal emulator". The term "terminal" in this documentation will assume this meaning.</p>
        <h2>Terminal Components</h2>
        <p>Each operating system decides the components that builds their own terminal API. However, there are some components that are common to all software of this type. Those are:</p>
        <h3>Window</h3>
        <p>A graphical window on a desktop environment or the whole monitor in case of embeded operating system terminals. It displays the output of an active running process. The terminal also keeps a buffer with the contents and properties to display.</p>
        <p>The window is composed by multiple cell of characters, spread horizontally, in columns, and vertically, in rows. To get the coordinate of a cell, an origin position at the top left corner of the window, where column and row are both zero, is considered. From there, the values of column and row increase going right and down respectively.</p>
        <p>The window may appear in many different dimensions. You can get the total of columns and rows that compose the terminal window at a given moment by using the <a href="tdk_getWindowDimensions.html"><code>tdk_getWindowDimensions</code></a> function.</p>
        <h3>Cursor</h3>
        <p>A special coordinate in the window that is used as reference when writting output onto the window. The terminal usually highlights this coordinate in the window using a specific shape that may be visible or not. You can manipulate those cursor properties by using the <code>tdk_getCursorCoordinate</code>, <code>tdk_setCursorShape</code> and <code>tdk_setCursorVisibility</code> functions.</p>
        <h3>Standard Streams</h3>
        <p>Any terminal process that is active at a given moment has access to three standard data streams, those are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>standard input or stdin (</strong><code>tdk_Stream_Input</code><strong>):</strong> from where it can read characters/events.</li>
            <li><strong>standard output or stdout (</strong><code>tdk_Stream_Output</code><strong>):</strong> where it can output regular tense messages.</li>
            <li><strong>standard error or stderr (</strong><code>tdk_Stream_Error</code><strong>):</strong> where it can output error tense messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these streams may be connected to a terminal (TTY) that will be providing user interactions or be a file in case of stream redirections and pipelines. You can check if a stream is a TTY by using the <code>tdk_isTTY</code> function.</p>
        <p>The standard output and error streams are writtable and you can write to them by using the <code>tdk_write</code>, <code>tdk_writeLine</code>, <code>tdk_writeError</code> and <code>tdk_writeErrorLine</code>.</p>
        <h3>Input Devices</h3>
        <p>Even though not exactly part of a terminal nowadays, input devices like a keyboard and mouse send character/events to a terminal input buffer and allow an user to interact with it.</p>
        <p>For simplicity and compatibility, this library only allows you to track synchronous key events by using the <code>tdk_readKeyEvent</code>.</p>
        <h2>Colors And Layers</h2>
        <p>Modern terminals usually support two palettes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>xterm palette:</strong> a palette of 256 specific colors. The first 16 colors have names and contain both a regular and light variants, these are also the ones defined in a terminal theme, thus they provide the best compatibility with those themes:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>black (<code>tdk_Color_Black</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightBlack</code>): same as values 0 and 8.</li>
                <li>red (<code>tdk_Color_Red</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightRed</code>): same as values 1 and 9.</li>
                <li>green (<code>tdk_Color_Green</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightGreen</code>): same as values 2 and 10.</li>
                <li>yellow (<code>tdk_Color_Yellow</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightYellow</code>): same as values 3 and 11.</li>
                <li>blue (<code>tdk_Color_Blue</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightBlue</code>): same as values 4 and 12.</li>
                <li>magenta (<code>tdk_Color_Magenta</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightMagenta</code>): same as values 5 and 13.</li>
                <li>cyan (<code>tdk_Color_Cyan</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightCyan</code>): same as values 6 and 14.</li>
                <li>white (<code>tdk_Color_White</code>/<code>tdk_Color_LightWhite</code>): same as values 7 and 15.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can set a color from this palette by using the <code>tdk_set256Color</code> function.</p>
            <li><strong>hex/rgb palette:</strong> this palette contains over 16.500.000 colors and it is very popular in the graphic design field. Terminals allow you to use them through a "truecolor" feature. You can set a color from this palette by using the <code>tdk_setHEXColor</code> and <code>tdk_setRGBColor</code> functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any color that you choose to apply must affect a certain terminal layer, that can be: the foreground (<code>tdk_Layer_Foreground</code>) or the background (<code>tdk_Layer_Background</code>).</p>
        <h2>Effects</h2>
        <p>Terminals can support a range of text effects. By using the <code>tdk_setEffect</code> function, you can set the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Italic (</strong><code>tdk_Effect_Italic</code><strong>):</strong> it makes the text look curly. It may require the use of a font with italic style to be seen.</li>
            <li><strong>Underline (</strong><code>tdk_Effect_Underline</code><strong>):</strong> it draws a horizontal line below the text.</li>
            <li><strong>Blinking (</strong><code>tdk_Effect_Blinking</code><strong>):</strong> it makes the text blink indefinetely over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Video(</strong><code>tdk_Effect_ReverseVideo</code><strong>):</strong> it swaps the foreground and background colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Conceal(</strong><code>tdk_Effect_Conceal</code><strong>):</strong> it makes the text invisible or hard to see.</li>
            <li><strong>Strikethrough(</strong><code>tdk_Effect_Strikethrough</code><strong>):</strong> it draws a horizontal line crossing into the middle of the text.</li>
        </ul>
