  <p>Terminal Development Kit - Documentation</p>
  <p>* This documentation refers to v8.0.0.<br /><a href="https://github.com/skippyr/libtdk" target="_blank">View Source Code</a></p>
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This is a simple C99 terminal manipulation library for Linux and Windows that can be used to develop cross-platform terminal application using C and C++. In summary, it includes features to manipulate terminal properties, styles and key events encoded in UTF-8.</p>
  <p>Designed to be an alternative to curses-like libraries, it offers a solid base for creating general purpose terminal based softwares, while leaving room to full-feature libraries to be built upon for more specific use cases.</p>
  <p>Throughout this documentation, you will learn the basic features of a terminal and how to use libtdk's functions to manipulate them.</p>
  <h2>What Is A Terminal</h2>
  <p>The terminal is a simple human-computer interface that allow people to interact with an operating system through a text based-command interpreter software called "shell".</p>
  <p>In the old days, a terminal used to be a real machine, but in the modern era its behavior is emulated through a software called "terminal emulator". The term "terminal" in this documentation will assume this meaning.</p>
  <h2>Terminal Components</h2>
  <p>Each operating system decide specify components to build their own terminal API system and built-in software. However, there are some components that are common to all software of this type:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>standard streams:</strong> a serie of standard data streams that processes running in a terminal can use to read and output data. Some of these streams may contain specifc buffers of characters and/or events.</li>
    <li><strong>screen:</strong> usually a window in a desktop environment where it can write data outputted by an active running process. The terminal also keeps a buffer in memory where it holds information about the characters and properties of each cell in its screen.</li>
    <li><strong>input devices:</strong> even though not exactly part of the terminal itself, input devices like a computer keyboard and mouse play the role of sending event/characters for a terminal to manipulate and allow an user to interact with it.</li>
  </ul>
