  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This is a simple C99 terminal manipulation library for Linux and Windows that can be used to develop cross-platform terminal application using C and C++. In summary, it includes features to manipulate terminal properties, styles and key events encoded in UTF-8.</p>
  <p>Designed to be an alternative to curses-like libraries, it offers a solid base for creating general purpose terminal based softwares, while leaving room to full-feature libraries to be built upon for more specific use cases.</p>
  <p>Throughout this documentation, you will learn the basic features of a terminal and how to use libtdk's functions to manipulate them.</p>
