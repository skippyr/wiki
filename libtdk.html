        <p>Terminal Development Kit - Documentation</p>
        <p>* This documentation refers to v8.0.0.<br /><a href="https://github.com/skippyr/libtdk" target="_blank">View Source Code</a></p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a simple C99 terminal manipulation library for Linux and Windows that can be used to develop cross-platform terminal application using C and C++. In summary, it includes features to manipulate terminal properties, styles and key events encoded in UTF-8.</p>
        <p>Designed to be an alternative to curses-like libraries, it offers a solid base for creating general purpose terminal based softwares, while leaving room to full-feature libraries to be built upon for more specific use cases.</p>
        <p>Throughout this documentation, you will learn the basics of the terminal and how to use libtdk's functions to manipulate it.</p>
        <h2>What Is A Terminal</h2>
        <p>The terminal is a simple human-computer interface that allow people to interact with an operating system through a text based-command interpreter software called "shell".</p>
        <p>In the old days, a terminal used to be a real machine, but in the modern era its behavior is emulated through a software called "terminal emulator". The term "terminal" in this documentation will assume this meaning.</p>
        <h2>Terminal Components</h2>
        <p>Each operating system decides the components that builds their own terminal API. However, there are some components that are common to all software of this type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>window:</strong> a window that displays the output of an active process. The terminal also keeps a buffer with the contents that it displays.</li>
            <li><strong>cursor:</strong> a special coordinate on the terminal window that is used as reference for writting output.</li>
            <li><strong>standard streams:</strong> a serie of standard data streams that an active process may use to read and output data. Some of these streams contain buffers of characters and/or events.</li>
            <li><strong>input devices:</strong> input devices like a keyboard and mouse send characters/events for a terminal to manipulate and allow an user to interact with it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Window</h3>
        <p>A graphical window on a desktop environment or the whole monitor in case of embeded operating system terminals. It displays the output of an active running process. The terminal also keeps a buffer with the contents and properties to display.</p>
        <p>The window is composed by multiple cell of characters, spread horizontally, in columns, and vertically, in rows. To get the coordinate of a cell, an origin position at the top left corner of the window, where column and row are both zero, is considered. From there, the values of column and row increase going right and down respectively.</p>
        <p>The window may appear in many different dimensions. You can get the total of columns and rows that compose the terminal window at a given moment by using the <code>tdk_getWindowDimensions</code> function.</p>
        <h3>Cursor</h3>
        <p>A special coordinate in the window that is used as reference when writting output onto the window. The terminal usually highlights this coordinate in the window using a specific shape that may be visible or not. You can manipulate those cursor properties by using the <code>tdk_getCursorCoordinate</code>, <code>tdk_setCursorShape</code> and <code>tdk_setCursorVisibility</code> functions.</p>
        <h3>Standard Streams</h3>
        <p>Any terminal process that is active at a given moment has access to three standard data streams, those are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>standard input or stdin (</strong><code>tdk_Stream_Input</code><strong>):</strong> from where it can read characters/events.</li>
            <li><strong>standard output or stdout (</strong><code>tdk_Stream_Output</code><strong>):</strong> where it can output regular tense messages.</li>
            <li><strong>standard error or stderr (</strong><code>tdk_Stream_Error</code><strong>):</strong> where it can output error tense messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these streams may be connected to a terminal (TTY) that will be providing user interactions or be a file in case of stream redirections and pipelines. You can check if a stream is a TTY by using the <code>tdk_isTTY</code> function.</p>
